# Selection_Sort_C_Algorithm
📘 Selection Sort Menu-Driven Program in C

📌 Overview

This program demonstrates Selection Sort in C using a menu-driven approach.
The user can:

1. Display the array


2. Sort the array using Selection Sort


3. Exit the program



Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning.

⚙️ Algorithm (Selection Sort)

1. Start with the first element as the minimum.


2. Compare it with all other elements to find the smallest.


3. Swap the smallest element with the current element.


4. Repeat the process for all elements until the array is sorted.


5. Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

Average Case: O(n²)



6. Space Complexity: O(1) (In-place sorting).
